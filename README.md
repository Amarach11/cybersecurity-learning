## Packet Tracer Office Network Project
This repository documents my learning process while designing and troubleshooting a multi-floor office network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The focus of this project is not just network creation, but understanding IP configuration, VLAN behavior, trunk links, and troubleshooting techniques.

## Network Overview

The network represents a basic office environment with multiple floors.  
Each floor contains end devices connected to access switches, which are linked through uplinks to allow inter-floor communication.

The design includes:
- Multiple access switches
- VLAN segmentation
- Trunk links between switches
- Manual IP configuration

## Initial Challenges

While building the network, I encountered several issues due to shallow understanding of core concepts:

- Incorrect IP configuration on end devices
- Confusion between access ports and trunk ports
- VLANs not communicating as expected
- Difficulty identifying why devices could not reach each other

At first, configurations were applied without fully understanding how IP addressing and VLANs interacted.

## Concepts Revisited and Learned

To fix these issues, I revisited the fundamentals and focused on understanding:

### IP Configuration
- Static IP addressing
- Network vs host portion of an IP address
- How incorrect IPs affect connectivity

### VLAN Configuration
- Creating VLANs
- Assigning switch ports to VLANs
- Understanding VLAN isolation

### Access and Trunk Ports
- Difference between access and trunk ports
- Why trunk ports are required between switches
- How VLAN traffic passes through trunk links

## Troubleshooting and Verification

Troubleshooting played a major role in improving my understanding.  
I focused on verifying configurations instead of guessing.

This included:
- Checking IP addresses and subnet consistency
- Verifying VLAN membership on switch ports
- Confirming trunk links between switches
- Testing connectivity to validate configurations

Through this process, I realized that troubleshooting is where networking concepts truly become clear.

## Reflection

This project helped me move from basic configuration to intentional network design.  
Previously, I could build networks that appeared correct but failed due to poor understanding.

By slowing down and focusing on fundamentals and troubleshooting, I now have a clearer understanding of how IP addressing, VLANs, and trunk links work together in real network environments.
